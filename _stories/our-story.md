## Our Story

Emily and James met on a early cold and snowy morning years before the would fall in love...
See, James is a coffee connoisseur, and has for most of his adult life sought out a fresh cup of the strongest
brew he can find to start his engines. Emily worked at one such establishment serving the areas finest coffee most mornings. 
Blindly James would visit each morning, eagerly order his usual "americano with an extra shot" oblivious of the love that awaited him on the other side of the espresso machine. 
Years later, unbeknownst to Emily who was out for lunch after an early afternoon Rockies game stumbles across James enjoying his after work (*maybe a little too early*) happy hour. They locked eyes, recognized each other in an instant "Hey Starbucks!" - "Hey, Americano James!"
