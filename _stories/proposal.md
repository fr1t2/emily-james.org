### The proposal



While we have lived under an unspoken vow of commitment and promise to each other it is finally time to make this official! Emily had wanted to go to this holiday lights event every year, but we kept missing the hard to get tickets every year. James decided enough was enough! He worked out a sitter for the kids, booked tickets to the festival at the [local botanical gardens](https://www.botanicgardens.org/events/special-events/blossoms-light) and bought a ring.

With hot cider in hand, and stockings on our heads while we walked through the thousands of holiday lights decorating the snow covered landscape on what Emily thought was a nice date night, but nothing special. 
In a space just off from the bustling of holiday crowd, James got on one knee and presented Emily with the ring. He asked to have her hand and heart for the rest of their lives offering his in return. 
Emily accepted immediately slipping the ring on her finger as tears of joy ran down their faces.
