### The Good Life

Not a short time later, we were inseparable. Our lives mingled and became one combining all the great things that made us into something wonderful. We moved into our place together in 2014, and can say that life was truly good. Amazing event after amazing event played out while we shared our love for each other and our growing family.
Somewhere in here we decided that we were going to spend the rest of our lives together.
